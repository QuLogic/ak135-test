 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   3.41395877E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.3191790580749512     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.26383581161499026     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
