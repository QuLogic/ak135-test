 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.19429482E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00078513E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.87411808967590332     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.17482361793518067     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    3338.2569844722748     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 55 m 38 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    3339.1311025619507     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 55 m 39 s
 We have done   2.61780098E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Fri Sep 05, 2014 20:44
