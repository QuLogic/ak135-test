 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   3.69564696E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00078513E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.32601213455200195     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   6.52024269104003878E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1245.0403418540955     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 20 m 45 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1245.3663539886475     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 20 m 45 s
 We have done   2.61780098E-02 % of that
