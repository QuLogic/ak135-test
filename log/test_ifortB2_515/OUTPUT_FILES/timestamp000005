 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.5938365E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012319E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.664635181427002     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.132927036285400     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    2524.94905424118     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 42 m 04 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    2525.61368942261     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 42 m 05 s
