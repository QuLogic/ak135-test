 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   1.19815108E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00071394E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.89914608001708984     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.17982921600341797     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    3613.6680955886841     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 00 m 13 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    3614.5672416687012     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 00 m 14 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 08:15
