 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.3647753E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012320E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.290802001953125     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   5.816040039062500E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1104.75680541992     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 18 m 24 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1105.04760742188     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 18 m 25 s
 We have done   2.6315790E-02 % of that
