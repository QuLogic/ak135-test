 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   9.38639423E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00123202E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.35368514060974121     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.07370281219482366E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1343.6498491764069     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 22 m 23 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1344.0035343170166     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 22 m 24 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that
