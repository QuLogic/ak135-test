 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.29753613471985     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.259507226943970     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    4955.29049849510     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 22 m 35 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    4956.58803462982     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 22 m 36 s
 We have done   2.6178010E-02 % of that
