 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   1.78691436E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00078513E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.69588494300842285     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.13917698860168456     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
