 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.36477528E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00123202E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.31948590278625488     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   6.38971805572509793E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1213.7269446849823     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 20 m 13 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1214.0464305877686     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 20 m 14 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Fri Sep 05, 2014 02:35
