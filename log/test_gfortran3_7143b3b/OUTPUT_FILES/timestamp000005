 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   4.39423136E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.3297009468078613     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.26594018936157227     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    5051.5338969230652     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 24 m 11 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    5052.8635978698730     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 24 m 12 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 06:50
