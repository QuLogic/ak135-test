 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   2.29594778E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00123202E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.99721693992614746     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.19944338798522948     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    3788.4271547794342     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 03 m 08 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    3789.4243717193604     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 03 m 09 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 22:16
