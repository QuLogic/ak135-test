 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   3.41395877E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.5382521152496338     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.30765042304992674     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    5843.8197858333588     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 37 m 23 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    5845.3580379486084     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 37 m 25 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Tue Sep 02, 2014 05:19
