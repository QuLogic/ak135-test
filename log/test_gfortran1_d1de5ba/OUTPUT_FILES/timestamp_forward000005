 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   7.49345490E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00078513E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.33331799507141113     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   6.66635990142822321E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1272.9414231777191     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 21 m 12 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1273.2747411727905     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 21 m 13 s
 We have done   2.61780098E-02 % of that
