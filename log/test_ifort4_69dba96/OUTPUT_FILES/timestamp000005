 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   7.2240073E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0014425E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.30690503120422     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.261381006240845     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
