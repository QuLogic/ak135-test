 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   4.85666591E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00094103E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.3209090232849121     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.46418180465698244     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    9327.7333645820618     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 35 m 27 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    9330.0542736053467     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 35 m 30 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 10:28
