 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.5938365E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012319E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.396943092346191     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.938861846923828E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1507.98680782318     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 25 m 07 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1508.38375091553     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 25 m 08 s
 We have done   2.6315790E-02 % of that
