 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   2.2959479E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012319E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.418793916702271     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   8.375878334045410E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1590.99808955193     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 26 m 30 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1591.41688346863     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 26 m 31 s
