 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.3647753E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012320E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.209262132644653     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   4.185242652893066E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    794.986841917038     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 14 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    795.196104049683     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 15 s
 We have done   2.6315790E-02 % of that
 
 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Mon Aug 25, 2014 22:00
