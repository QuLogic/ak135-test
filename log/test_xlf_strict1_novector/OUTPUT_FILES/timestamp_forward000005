 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =  0.7038721378E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =  0.1000713939E-23
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =  0.209143877029418945
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =  0.418287754058837905E-01
 
 Time steps done =  5  out of  20100
