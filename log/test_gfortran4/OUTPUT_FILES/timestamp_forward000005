 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   5.22539020E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00094103E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.2939591407775879     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.45879182815551756     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    9219.4217867851257     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 33 m 39 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    9221.7157459259033     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 33 m 41 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Thu Aug 07, 2014 02:05
