 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   3.91665817E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00071394E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.37514185905456543     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.50283718109130832E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1507.6951315402985     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 25 m 07 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1508.0702733993530     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 25 m 08 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that
