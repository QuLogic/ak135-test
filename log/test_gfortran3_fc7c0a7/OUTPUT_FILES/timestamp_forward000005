 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   3.37853737E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00102002E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.4911050796508789     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.29822101593017580     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
