 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   5.58084808E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00102002E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.4838578701019287     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.49677157402038574     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    9485.8532059192657     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 38 m 05 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    9488.3370637893677     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 38 m 08 s
 We have done   2.61780098E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Tue Sep 02, 2014 18:02
