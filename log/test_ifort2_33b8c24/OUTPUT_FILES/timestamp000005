 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.1942949E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0007851E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.354942083358765     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.098841667175293E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1348.42497467995     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 22 m 28 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1348.77991676331     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 22 m 28 s
 We have done   2.6315790E-02 % of that
