 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   7.22400728E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.1528589725494385     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.43057179450988770     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    8178.7112367153168     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 16 m 18 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    8180.8640956878662     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 16 m 20 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Tue Sep 02, 2014 20:37
