 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   1.67441918E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00071394E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.72664880752563477     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.14532976150512694     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    2920.4015574455261     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 48 m 40 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    2921.1282062530518     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 48 m 41 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Aug 06, 2014 18:47
