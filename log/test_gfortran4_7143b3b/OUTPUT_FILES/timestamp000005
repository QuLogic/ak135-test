 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   7.22400728E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.1128690242767334     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.42257380485534668     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    8026.7894232273102     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 13 m 46 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    8028.9022922515869     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 13 m 48 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 07:14
