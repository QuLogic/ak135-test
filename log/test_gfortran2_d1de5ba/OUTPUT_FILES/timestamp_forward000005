 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.78707021E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00078513E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.64253306388854980     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.12850661277770997     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    2453.8337709903717     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 40 m 53 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    2454.4763040542603     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 40 m 54 s
 We have done   2.61780098E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 19:46
