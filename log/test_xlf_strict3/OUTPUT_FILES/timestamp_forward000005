 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =  0.3161697823E-03
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =  0.1000941032E-23
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =  1.04864287376403809
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =  0.209728574752807623
