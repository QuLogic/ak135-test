 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.25723695755005     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.251447391510010     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    5052.83533239365     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 24 m 12 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    5054.09256935120     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 24 m 14 s
 We have done   2.4875622E-02 % of that
