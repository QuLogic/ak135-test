 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   7.03872138E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00071394E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.55615520477294922     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.11123104095458984     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
