 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.18989515304565     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.237979030609131     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    4782.18862009048     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 19 m 42 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    4783.37851524353     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 19 m 43 s
 We have done   2.4875622E-02 % of that
 
 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 10:28
