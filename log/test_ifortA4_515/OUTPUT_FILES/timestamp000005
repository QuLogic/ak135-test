 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.9945148E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0014425E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.26186800003052     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.252373600006104     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    4793.83653211594     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 19 m 53 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    4795.09840011597     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 19 m 55 s
 We have done   2.6315790E-02 % of that
 
 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Mon Aug 25, 2014 19:35
