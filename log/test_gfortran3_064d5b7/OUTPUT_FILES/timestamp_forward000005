 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   2.65557843E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00094103E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.5923449993133545     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.31846899986267091     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    6399.6345522403717     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 46 m 39 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    6401.2268972396851     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      1 h 46 m 41 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 08:58
