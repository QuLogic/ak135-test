 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   9.3863950E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012320E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.187882900238037     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   3.757658004760742E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    713.767138004303     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 11 m 53 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    713.955020904541     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 11 m 53 s
