 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   7.03872138E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00071394E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.37275218963623047     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.45504379272460965E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1498.0910501480103     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 24 m 58 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1498.4638023376465     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 24 m 58 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Thu Aug 14, 2014 02:33
