 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =   3.16169811E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =   1.00094103E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.9665088653564453     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.39330177307128905     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        20100
 Time steps remaining =        20095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    7903.3991298675537     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 11 m 43 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    7905.3656387329102     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      2 h 11 m 45 s
 We have done   2.48756222E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Aug 06, 2014 23:56
