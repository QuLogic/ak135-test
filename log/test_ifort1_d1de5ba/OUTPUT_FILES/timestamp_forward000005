 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   7.4934549E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0007851E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.211622953414917     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   4.232459068298340E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    808.188059091568     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 28 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    808.399682044983     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 28 s
