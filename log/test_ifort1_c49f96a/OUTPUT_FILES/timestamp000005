 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   3.6956470E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0007851E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.213992834091187     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   4.279856681823731E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19100
 Time steps remaining =        19095
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    817.238633394241     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 37 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    817.452626228333     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 13 m 37 s
