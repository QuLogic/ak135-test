 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   9.38639423E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00123202E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.30099797248840332     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   6.01995944976806627E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1143.4912974834442     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 19 m 03 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1143.7922954559326     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 19 m 03 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Wed Sep 03, 2014 21:02
