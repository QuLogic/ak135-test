 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.99451480E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00144245E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =    2.1025280952453613     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 02 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.42050561904907224     

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    7987.5042338371277     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 13 m 07 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    7989.6067619323730     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    2 h 13 m 09 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Tue Sep 02, 2014 17:54
