 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.9945148E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0014425E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =    1.11755299568176     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 01 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.223510599136353     
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    4245.58383059502     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 10 m 45 s
 
 Estimated total run time in seconds =    4246.70138359070     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    1 h 10 m 46 s
