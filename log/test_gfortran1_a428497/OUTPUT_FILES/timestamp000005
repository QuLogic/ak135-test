 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   5.36477528E-05
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.00123202E-24

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.31033110618591309     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   6.20662212371826186E-002

 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
 Time steps remaining =        18995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =    1178.9478724002838     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 19 m 38 s

 Estimated total run time in seconds =    1179.2582035064697     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 19 m 39 s
 We have done   2.63157897E-02 % of that

 The run will finish approximately on (in local time): Mon Sep 01, 2014 23:28
