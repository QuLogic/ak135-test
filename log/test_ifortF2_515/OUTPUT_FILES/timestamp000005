 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =   1.5938365E-04
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices =   1.0012319E-24
 
 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.371944904327393     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   7.438898086547852E-002
 
 Time steps done =            5  out of        19000
